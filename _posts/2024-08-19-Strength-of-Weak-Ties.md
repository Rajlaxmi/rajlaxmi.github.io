Theories on building networks for greater information flow.

<!--more-->

### The Strength of Weak Ties
This concept was first introduced by sociologist Mark Granovetter in his seminal 1973 paper. Granovetter found that weak ties serve as crucial bridges between different social groups, facilitating the flow of novel information and resources across otherwise disconnected parts of the social network. Strong ties, while important for emotional support, tend to reinforce the same ideas and opportunities that already exist within a close-knit group.

### Situational Awareness

"Good situational awareness requires diverse relationships, diverse networks, and the active cultivation and maintenance of those networks," says Massey. "It means getting out of your day-to-day and breaking your routines in order to learn something that you wouldn't otherwise. It's a long-term investment with the potential for big payoffs."
