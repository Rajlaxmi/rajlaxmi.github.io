Title: Word2Vec
---

Word2Vec is a neural net algorithm to express word to k-dimensional algorithm. The vector typically represents word's
representation in lower dimensional space.
Word2Vec is foundational algorithm upon which many NLP algorithms are built upon. This style of algorithm can also be
used in recommender and advertising systems. It has potential usage where SVD or lower dimensional representation of
features are required.
