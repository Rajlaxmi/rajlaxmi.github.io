### Active Learning

This approach involves engaging actively with the material rather than passively consuming it. It often includes activities such as discussions, problem-solving, and practical application of knowledge.

### Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is the act of learning and then reviewing at spaced intervals, preferably with increasing intervals between them. 

1-3-7-14: Review day 1 (right after learning), then 3, then 7 and 14 from when you start.\

### Mind Mapping

A visual technique that helps organize information hierarchically using diagrams, with key concepts branching out into related subtopics. It aids in understanding relationships between ideas and enhances memory retention.

Better memory and recall, Better creativity, Better connections between concepts

### Self-Testing

Involves testing oneself on the material to assess understanding and retention. It reinforces learning by identifying areas of weakness that require further review.

### Active Recall

Involves retrieving information from memory without the aid of notes or textbooks. It strengthens memory by actively engaging the brain in recalling information.

### Note-taking

Involves summarizing and recording key points from lectures or readings. Effective note-taking helps organize information, aids in comprehension, and provides a useful resource for review.

### Practice and Application

Involves applying learned concepts through practical exercises or real-world scenarios. It enhances understanding and reinforces learning by demonstrating how theoretical knowledge can be put into practice.

### Mnemonics

Techniques or strategies used to improve memory retention by associating information with easier-to-remember cues or patterns. Examples include acronyms, rhymes, and visual imagery.

### Interleaved Practice

Alternating between different topics or types of problems during study sessions. It enhances learning by promoting varied practice and improving retention compared to massed practice on a single topic.

### Group Study

Collaborative learning where students work together to review material, discuss concepts, and solve problems. It facilitates peer teaching, diverse perspectives, and social reinforcement of learning.

### Pomodoro

A time management method where study or work is divided into intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. It helps maintain focus and productivity by breaking tasks into manageable segments.

### Growth Mindset

The belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort, perseverance, and learning. It encourages resilience, learning from failures, and embracing challenges.

### No Multitasking

Focusing on one task at a time rather than attempting to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously. It enhances concentration, reduces errors, and improves productivity and learning outcomes.

### Minimizing Distractions

Removing or reducing distractions in the study environment to maintain focus and concentration. It includes strategies like turning off notifications, finding a quiet space, or using noise-canceling headphones.

### Time Management

Techniques and strategies for effectively allocating and prioritizing time for study, work, and other activities. It involves setting goals, creating schedules, and minimizing procrastination.

### Cheat Sheets

Concise summaries or reference sheets containing key information or formulas. They serve as quick guides for review and are often used for last-minute preparation before exams or assessments.
