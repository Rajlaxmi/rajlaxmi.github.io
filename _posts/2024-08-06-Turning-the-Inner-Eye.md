"Happiness is like a butterfly: the more you chase it, the more it will elude you." - Thoreau

I have recently been feeling very confident secure and at peace with myself which has been an amazing feeling! My strut is different, my ability to forego the noise and focus on things I find rewarding has led me to be even more productive.

Although its fairly obvious, I have realised you have no one to impress but yourself. Hone your own interests. Most of the world is busy trying to be someone else, trying to impress someone else. Once you realise you are enough, you turn the eye inwards and question: What do I enjoy? What should be my unique contribution to the world? Find them and experience the joy the working tirelessly at them.
