Critical Thinking Framework

<!--more-->
Richard Paul & Linda Elder define critical thinking as “the art of analyzing and evaluating thinking with a view to improving it,” achieved by taking charge of the structures of thought and applying intellectual standards to them. Their framework distinguishes three layers:

1. The Elements of Reasoning – purpose, question, information, concepts, assumptions, inferences, point of view, implications.

2. Intellectual Standards – clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, logic, significance, fairness.

3. Intellectual Virtues – humility, courage, empathy, integrity, perseverance, confidence in reason, autonomy.
