Advice from brilliant mathematician [Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao) on building a career in mathematics.
<!--more-->


[Does one have to be a genius to do maths?](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths/)
The answer is an emphatic **NO**. In order to make good and useful contributions to mathematics, one does need to [work hard](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/work-hard/), [learn one’s field well](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-and-relearn-your-field/), [learn other fields](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/dont-be-afraid-to-learn-things-outside-your-field/) and [tools](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-the-power-of-other-mathematicians-tools/), [ask questions](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-and-answer-them/), [talk to other mathematicians](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/attend-talks-and-conferences-even-those-not-directly-related-to-your-work/), and [think about the “big picture”](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/think-ahead/). And yes, a reasonable amount of intelligence, [patience](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-patient/), and [maturity](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-professional-in-your-work/) is also required. But one does not need some sort of magic “genius gene”.

### [Work hard](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/work-hard/)

*My takeaways*: Work hard. Relying on intelligence alone does not work.

*From the blog*: \
One needs to do a serious amount of reading and writing, and not just thinking, in order to get anywhere serious in mathematics. Relying on intelligence alone to pull things off at the last minute may work for a while, but, generally speaking, at the graduate level or higher it doesn’t.

### [Learn and relearn your field](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-and-relearn-your-field/)

*My take-aways*: How to think critically and question assumptions.

*From the blog*: \
Just because you know a statement and proof of Fundamental Lemma X, you shouldn’t take that lemma for granted; instead, you should dig deeper until you really understand what the lemma is all about:

Can you find alternate proofs? 
Do you know why each of the hypotheses are necessary?
What kind of generalizations are known/conjectured/heuristic?
When is it a good idea to use the lemma, and when isn’t it?

### [Ask yourself dumb questions – and answer them!](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-and-answer-them/)

*My takeaways*: Avoid passive reading, actively critique the material.

*From the blog*: \
Don’t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? 

### [Enjoy your work](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/enjoy-your-work/)

### [Don’t be afraid to learn things outside your field](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/dont-be-afraid-to-learn-things-outside-your-field/)

*My takeaways*: Dont pigeonhole yourself.

*From the blog*: \
If it turns out that in order to make progress on your problem, you have to learn some external piece of mathematics, this is a good thing – your own mathematical range will increase.

### [Attend talks and conferences, even those not directly related to your work](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/attend-talks-and-conferences-even-those-not-directly-related-to-your-work/)

*My takeaways*: Talk to other researchers. Explore what's going on in the field.

*From the blog*: \
You need to know what’s going on elsewhere in mathematics, and what other mathematicians find interesting; this will often give valuable perspectives on your own work. (Yes, it is possible to solve a major problem after working in isolation for years – but only after you first talk to other mathematicians and learn all the techniques, intuition, and other context necessary to crack such problems.)


### [Be professional in your work](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-professional-in-your-work/)

*My takeaways*: Being professional in workplace and with colleagues.

*From the blog*: \
Take your duties and responsibilities seriously; being frivolous is fine with friends, but can be annoying for your colleagues, especially those who are busy with similar responsibilities.

Exercise professional courtesy and respect for the time and efforts of your colleagues.  Unless you are already on good casual terms with the person you are interacting with, send them an email (or text, if you are close enough to share phone numbers) to schedule a call or meeting rather than just showing up or calling unannounced.

### [Think ahead](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/think-ahead/)

*My takeaways*: Try to pause and recall the bigger picture of pursuing a particular goal.

*From the blog*: \
Worse than being blind, is to see and have no vision.
It is really easy to get bogged down in the details of some work and not recall the purpose of what one is actually doing; thus it is good to pause every now and then and recall why one is pursuing a particular goal.

### [Be Patient](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-patient/)

*My takeaways*: Being patient. Hard problems take large effort. Take advantage of breakthroughs by eliminating *fruitless avenues of attack*.

*From the blog*: \
If I have ever made any valuable discoveries, it has been owing more to patient attention, than to any other talent. - Issac Newton

Any given problem generally requires months of effort in order to make satisfactory progress.  While it is possible for routine or unexpectedly easy problems to fall within weeks, this is the exception rather than the rule. Thus it is not uncommon for months to pass with no visible progress; however by patiently eliminating fruitless avenues of attack, you are setting things up so that when the breakthrough does come, one can conclude the problem in relatively short order. 

### [Be flexible](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-flexible/)

*My takeaways*: Unpredictable field. Be flexible.

*From the blog*: \
Mathematical research is by its nature unpredictable – if we knew in advance what the answer would be and how to do it, it wouldn’t be research! You should therefore be prepared for research to lead you in unexpected directions, and it may end up that you may find a new problem or area of mathematics more interesting than the one you were initially working in.
