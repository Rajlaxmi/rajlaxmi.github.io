# Critical Thinking Framework

Explore the three essential layers of critical thinking—Elements of Reasoning, Intellectual Standards, and Intellectual Virtues—based on the framework by Richard Paul & Linda Elder.

Critical thinking is the art of analyzing and evaluating thinking with a view to improving it. Richard Paul & Linda Elder describe a framework for taking charge of the structures of thought and applying intellectual standards to them.

## The Three Layers of Critical Thinking
Their framework distinguishes three essential layers:

### 1. Elements of Reasoning
Every act of reasoning contains these eight moving parts. Mapping them makes hidden weaknesses visible.
Purpose, question, information, concepts, assumptions, inferences, point of view, implications.

| Element | Guiding Question |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Why am I doing this thinking? |
| Question / Problem | What precise question am I answering? |
| Information / Data | What facts, observations, or experiences am I using? |
| Interpretations & Inferences | What conclusions am I drawing from that information? |
| Concepts & Theories | What ideas, definitions, or principles organize my thinking? |
| Assumptions | What am I taking for granted? |
| Implications & Consequences | If I’m right, what follows? |
| Point of View | From which perspective am I looking? What others exist? |

### 2. Intellectual Standards
Once the elements are on the table, you interrogate each with nine standards:
Clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, logic, significance, fairness.

| Standard | Guiding Question |
| --- | --- |
| Clarity | Could I state this more plainly? |
| Accuracy | Is it true and verifiable? |
| Precision | Can I be more exact or specific? |
| Relevance | Does it bear directly on the issue? |
| Depth | Have I dealt with the complexities? |
| Breadth | Have I considered other viewpoints? |
| Logic | Do the ideas fit together coherently? |
| Significance | Which points matter most? |
| Fairness | Am I free of bias and vested interest? |

### 3. Intellectual Virtues
Repeated use of the standards etches habits of mind:
Humility, courage, empathy, integrity, perseverance, confidence in reason, autonomy.

| Trait | Observable Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Humility | “I might be wrong—let’s check.” |
| Courage | Willingness to question cherished beliefs. |
| Empathy | Serious effort to enter other viewpoints. |
| Integrity | Apply the same standards to yourself that you apply to others. |
| Perseverance | Sustained effort despite difficulty or frustration. |
| Confidence in Reason | Trust that sound logic and evidence lead toward truth. |
| Autonomy | Thinking independently while respecting evidence. |
