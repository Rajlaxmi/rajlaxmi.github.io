I am a software engineer working at applied machine learning teams at Google. I am interested in large language model research, particularly LLM applied to reasoning and maths, alignment and multimodality.

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajlaxmi-a6b28942/). I maintain a novice photography page [here](https://www.instagram.com/raila.snapshots/).
