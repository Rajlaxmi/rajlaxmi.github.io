---

I am a software engineer on the applied machine learning teams at Google. My research interests include applying LLMs to reasoning and mathematics, alignment, and multimodality.

Lux mentis, Lux orbis. Light of the mind, light of the world.
I am driven by my curiosity and learning from the collective stream of consciousness of past and present intellectuals. My other interests include Botany, Medical sciences, Human body, History art and architecture, Political and governance structures around the world.
